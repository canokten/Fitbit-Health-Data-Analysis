## Dataset Used

The dataset for this case study is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, available on Kaggle and provided by Mobius.

### Methods

These datasets were collected from respondents via a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and May 12, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

### Accessibility and Privacy of Data

The metadata verifies that this dataset is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain, waiving all rights worldwide under copyright law, including related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. This allows anyone to copy, modify, distribute, and use the work, even for commercial purposes, without needing permission.

### Data Organization and Verification

The dataset comprises 18 CSV files, each representing different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit. The data is considered long format since each row corresponds to one time point per subject, resulting in multiple rows per user. Each user has a unique ID, and data is tracked by day and time.

### Data Credibility and Integrity

The dataset's small sample size (33 users) and lack of demographic information pose a risk of sampling bias. It is unclear if the sample represents the broader population. Additionally, the dataset is outdated, covering only a two-month period, limiting its current relevance.
